:bee: Extended Parchment

I stumbled upon the [Parchment Theme](https://github.com/rhl-bthr/parchment) and really loved it. I've been locally developing my site/blog using this theme, but I've added tons of new features. It's still an ongoing thing because I'm not getting enough time to finalize everything. Anyway, I have finally decided to put the theme out here in chunks and pieces, so consider this as an announcement or whatever.
